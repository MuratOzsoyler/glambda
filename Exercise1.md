Exercise 1: Extend `zero`
=========================

The first exercise is to extend the `zero` function we have just seen.

In the `glambda` repo, look in the `exercises` directory and open up
`Ex1.hs`. The code we've been discussing should appear.

Add constructors for
 * `[]`  (the list type)
 * `Wrap` (defined in the file)
 * `()`   (the unit type), and
 * `(->)`

Add clauses of `zero` for these as well.

The solution is available in `Ex1.hs` in the `solutions` branch.
